Adding a band:

There's a lot to doing this correctly. When you add a band, you should also be connecting that band to its hometown. I
think it's fair to say bands are not useful in the database if they're not tied to locations.

In that respect, perhaps I enforce that as a rule. That way I can make the assumption that if a band already exists,
then so does their relationship to a place.

Nah. Sometimes I'm going to miss them. I'd rather just build the tool to account for all possibilities.

First and foremost, once you've retrieved the band node from facebook, you need to determine whether it already exists
in the database. If it doesn't add it.

Next, you need to determine whether its location (city) already exists in the database. If it doesn't, add it. Adding
a city also means adding a relationship from that city to a state. Add that as well.

Finally, add the relationship between the band and the city to the database.

band = facebook.get('band', 'theroyalthey')

if band not in database:
    database.add(band)
    if band.location.city not in database:
        database.add(band.location.city)
        database.relate(band, band.location.city)

if band not related to band.location.city:
    database.relate(band, band.location.city)

Here I'm not assuming if the band exists that it has a relationship to a city. This is just to make sure this process
will update existing nodes if for some reason they end up in the database without being tied to a location. Which is
possible.

Caveats to the above pseudocode:
- If the location is part of the object returned from facebook, it needs to be stripped before it can be added to the
  database.
- The location has to be known in order to determine whether that location exists in the database (DUH).

Regex to find a string that is neither preceded by nor followed by any alphanumeric characters:
(?<=[^a-zA-z])NY(?=[^a-zA-z])

This is the regex tweaked to account for start and end of line parameters:
((?<=[^a-zA-z])|^)NY(?=[^a-zA-z]|$)

I can use this to parse location from the hometown attribute if I so choose.

The strategy I'd propose for that is:
- scan the hometown string for any of the state abbreviations in the database
- if none are found, scan the string again for any of the actual state names in the database
- if none are found, return with nothing
- if one IS found, chop the string off at the start index of the state
- search for the last capitalized word in the string, and any capitalized words that immediately precede that, before
  any commas, other punctuation, or lowercased words:

    'Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY' --> 'Bushwick, Brooklyn, ' --> 'Brooklyn'
    'Riverdel, The Bronx, NY' --> 'Riverdel, The Bronx, ' --> 'The Bronx'
    'Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY' --> 'Lower East Side, Manhattan, ' --> 'Manhattan'

Welp, it's been at least a month since I last worked on this, and in that time I've created an entire Python module
dedicated to this location parsing task, which turned out to be considerably more complicated than I originally
anticipated. Hopefully it won't turn out to have been a complete misuse of my time, but it works, so there's at least
some value in that.

    >>> import PushPin
    >>> PushPin.locate('Brooklyn, NY')
    ({'name': u'Brooklyn'}, {'abbr': u'NY', 'name': u'New York'})
    >>> PushPin.locate('Garwood, NJ')
    ({'name': u'Garwood'}, {'abbr': u'NJ', 'name': u'New Jersey'})

Pushpin takes a string indicating a location, parses it, and returns a tuple of the city and state.

It can handle pretty spartan location names:

    >>> PushPin.locate('Brooklyn')
    ({'name': u'Brooklyn'}, {'abbr': u'NY', 'name': u'New York'})

It can also handle multiple locations and multiple delimiter types (in such cases it just picks one, usually the larger
of the two):

    >>> PushPin.locate('Philadelphia, PA / Boston, MA')
    ({'name': u'Boston'}, {'abbr': u'MA', 'name': u'Massachusetts'})

If the location isn't real, it'll return a tuple of None, None:

    >>> PushPin.locate('Your Town')
    (None, None)


All the above is pointless. I've scrapped all of it and am now using the Google API. Moral of story: don't reinvent
the fucking wheel for no good reason.


Anyway, moving on.


In adding events, here are some things to keep in mind:
- If the event already exists in the database, it should probably be skipped
    - Although it may be worth hanging onto in case there are new bands in the database that the event should be
      connected to
- If the event has no place/location associated with it, it is not useful and should be skipped


example command:
>>> python rg.py add events at ourwickedlady

- ensure ourwickedlady is in the database
- retrieve all events occurring at ourwickedlady from fb graph
- retrieve all bands in the database
- scan all events in fb graph result for band names


It is possible for the location of an event to be untied to an actual facebook venue page. At some point I'll need to
figure out what to do in those cases.


The Gutter is so fucking annoying for no reason. They have a facebook page, all their events are linked to it, but
nothing in the graph API actually allows me to access their information. Some kind of permissions setting they've
set up? Why even have a facebook page then?
